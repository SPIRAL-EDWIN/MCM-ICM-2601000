- Then read the 2025_MCM_Problem_B.pdf.
- Not sure yet what the user wants as the end result.

## Technical Decisions
- None yet. We’re just gathering context.

## Research Findings
- No content read yet.

## Open Questions
- Do they want a summary or detailed analysis?
- Is there a specific goal after reading the PDF?

## Scope Boundaries
- INCLUDE: Possibly reading folder structure, organizing their MCM steps.
- EXCLUDE: Not asked to solve the MCM problem or produce a plan yet.
