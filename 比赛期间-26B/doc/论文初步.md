\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Background}

Humanity's desire to explore the cosmos continually pushes the boundaries of technology and ambition. Since ancient times and the legendary Tower of Babel, building a tower reaching the sky has been part of our ambition. With advancing technology, we now possess the capability to forecast and deploy solutions to realize this ambition, beginning with the Moon through space elevator systems. The ultimate vision involves the deployment of three galactic ports in the equatorial region, each connected to an anchor point at the apex of the Geostationary orbit (GEO). Crucially, the space elevator transforms space transportation from a pure discrete pulse problem (rockets) into a continuous flow problem.

Building upon this foundational technology, humanity is poised to transition from observation to sustained habitation. The Moon Colonization Management (MCM) has proposed an ambitious plan: establishing a permanent settlement for 100,000 people upon completion of the space elevator system by 2050. Constructing and maintaining this lunar colony will require transporting approximately 100 million metric tons of materials from Earth—a scale that exceeds the combined total of all previous space missions by several orders of magnitude.

\subsection{Restatement of the Problem}

This unprecedented logistical challenge demands rigorous quantitative frameworks for evaluating transportation strategies. The core contradiction lies in what we term the \textbf{cost-risk-time triple dilemma}. While space elevators promise significantly reduced marginal costs, they introduce systemic risks due to innovative carbon nanotube tether technology. Conversely, mature rocket technology offers operational flexibility but incurs high economic and environmental costs.

This study employs multi-objective optimization to resolve this triple dilemma, ultimately addressing the fundamental question: How should humanity construct the first planetary-scale supply chain?

Based on the technological capabilities of 2050, we face three viable strategic paradigms: pure elevator transport, pure rocket transport, or an integrated approach that combines both. This fusion leverages the strengths of rockets and elevators to balance cost-effectiveness with temporal flexibility.

Each paradigm requires trade-offs across four critical dimensions: \textbf{economic cost, project timeline, operational reliability, and environmental sustainability}. This complexity requires a systematic quantitative decision-making framework. Through in-depth analysis of problem requirements and modeling objectives, we identify the following core research questions:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Strategic Selection under Ideal Conditions:} Which transportation paradigm should be selected to deliver 100 million metric tons of materials to the Moon, optimizing the trade-off between economic cost and project timeline?
    
    \item \textbf{Robust Decision-Making under Uncertainty:} How should the optimal strategy be adjusted when accounting for random disturbances (Swaying of the graphene techers, launch anomalies, Elevator Operational Failures, etc.)?
    
    \item \textbf{Critical Resource Logistics (Water Supply):} How should the transportation infrastructure be configured to sustain the water cycle of a 100,000-person colony, ensuring both steady-state supply and emergency resilience?
    
    \item \textbf{Sustainability-Constrained Optimization:} When environmental externalities (atmospheric pollution, noise exposure, land occupation) are integrated into the objective function, how does the optimal strategy shift—and what are the policy implications for planetary-scale logistics?
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Our Work}

\section{Preparation for Modeling}

\subsection{General Assumptions}
To simplify the complex planetary-scale logistics problem while retaining its core physical and economic characteristics, we make the following assumptions based on the technological horizon of 2050:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Assumption 1: Technological Maturity \& Material feasibility.}
    
    We assume that by 2050 the space elevator has been constructed, with its construction costs excluded from the model. Similarly, heavy-lift launch vehicles are expected to reach operational maturity, featuring stable single-launch reliability ($q_R$) and standardized marginal costs.
    
    \item \textbf{Assumption 2: Distinct Logistics Mechanisms.}
    The Space Elevator is modeled as a \textit{Continuous-Flow System} (analogous to a pipeline), whereas the Rocket Fleet is modeled as a \textit{Discrete Impulse System}. This fundamental physical distinction dictates that queuing theory applies strictly to rocket launch windows, while the elevator is constrained only by annual throughput capacity.
    
    \item \textbf{Assumption 3: Linear Superposition of Externalities.}
    For Environmental Modeling (Problem 4), we assume that environmental impacts—specifically Atmospheric Pollution ($I_{AP}$) and Noise Dosage ($L_{dn}$)—accumulate linearly with launch frequency. We ignore complex non-linear atmospheric chemical coupling to maintain model solvability, focusing instead on first-order cumulative effects.
    
    \item \textbf{Assumption 4: Economic Baseline.}
    All monetary values are normalized to a constant 2025 USD to eliminate inflationary distortion. The "Time Cost" implicitly accounts for the discount rate of future value, treating project duration as a direct economic penalty.
\end{itemize}

For environmental impact, we strictly followed the \textbf{FAA Order 1050.1F} for noise calculations and adopted lifecycle assessment (LCA) data for atmospheric emissions. All economic figures are adjusted to 2025 USD to maintain financial consistency.






\section{Three-Scenarios Analysis Under Ideal Conditions}

\subsection{Problem Analysis}
This section formulates a logistic strategy to transport $10^8$ metric tons of payload to the Moon, evaluating three paradigms: (A) Space Elevator, (B) Rocket Fleet, and (C) Hybrid Strategy. The core challenge lies in the \textbf{"Cost-Time Trade-off"}: balancing the "Cost-Efficient" Space Elevator against the "Time-Efficient" Rocketry. To quantify this, we first identify the optimal global launch infrastructure and then construct a weighted multi-objective optimization model.

\subsection{Infrastructure Optimization: Launch Site Screening}
To determine the upper bound of the Rocket Fleet's capacity, we screened ten global launch sites. 

\textbf{1. Multi-Criteria Evaluation (TOPSIS):} 
We ranked sites based on \textbf{Latitude} (15\%, orbital efficiency), \textbf{Historical Activity} (20\%), and \textbf{Growth Potential} (20\%). As shown in Figure \ref{fig:topsis_bubble}, \textbf{Florida} (0.841) and \textbf{California} (0.632) emerged as top candidates, while \textbf{New Zealand} was retained for its growth potential.

\textbf{2. Capacity Prediction (GM(1,1)):} 
Using a \textbf{Logistic-corrected GM(1,1) Model}, we forecasted the annual throughput of the selected sites (Figure \ref{fig:GM(1,1)}), imposing a physical constraint of daily turnarounds ($K=365$).
\textbf{Conclusion:} The aggregated global launch capacity stabilizes at $R_{avg} \approx 1,472$ launches/year. This value serves as the maximum throughput parameter ($Cap_R$) for the rocket system in the subsequent modeling.

\end{minipage}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Model Construction and Weight Definition}
We define the decision variable $\alpha \in [0, 1]$ as the proportion of cargo transported by the Space Elevator.

\subsubsection{Mathematical Formulation}
\textbf{1. Temporal Model (Parallel Processing Logic):} \\
The system's total duration is constrained by the bottleneck mode. Based on the capacity ($Cap_E, Cap_R$) derived above:
\begin{equation}
    T_{total}(\alpha) = \max \left( \underbrace{\frac{\alpha M_{total}}{Cap_E}}_{T_{elevator}}, \; \underbrace{\frac{(1-\alpha) M_{total}}{Cap_R}}_{T_{rocket}} \right)
\end{equation}
This "Min-Max" structure creates a V-shaped time curve, where efficiency is maximized when $T_{elevator} \approx T_{rocket}$.

\textbf{2. Economic Model:} \\
The total cost combines variable transport costs and fixed maintenance costs (weighted by operational intensity):
\begin{equation}
    C_{total}(\alpha) = \underbrace{\left[ \alpha \cdot(C_E^{elev}+C_E^{rkt}) + (1-\alpha)\cdot C_R^{unit} \right] \cdot M_{total}}_{\text{Marginal Cost}} + \underbrace{\left[ \alpha\cdot F_E + (1-\alpha)\cdot F_R \right] \cdot T_{total}(\alpha)}_{\text{Fixed Maintenance Cost}}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Weight Determination (Project Management Theory)}
To evaluate the trade-off, we construct a composite index $Z$:
\begin{equation}
    \min Z(\alpha) = w_c \cdot \tilde{C}_{norm} + w_t \cdot \tilde{T}_{norm}
\end{equation}
Based on \textit{Flyvbjerg's (2003)} analysis of mega-projects(Table 2), cost overruns pose a greater systemic risk than schedule delays.

\centering
\caption{Weight Allocation in Mega-Project Performance Evaluation}

\begin{tabular}{lccc}

UK Infrastructure Projects Authority & 0.55 & 0.35 & 1.57 \\
World Bank Infrastructure Assessment & 0.50 & 0.30 & 1.67 \\
NASA Major Project Reviews & 0.55 & 0.45 & 1.22 \\

\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\begin{tablenotes}
\small
\item Note: Remaining weights may be allocated to quality, safety, or other performance dimensions not shown.
\end{tablenotes}
\end{table}


Following PMI standards for capital-intensive infrastructure, we prioritize economic sustainability:
\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{W} = [w_c, w_t] = [0.6, 0.4]
\end{equation}

\subsection{Simulation Results and Conclusion}
The simulation results reveal the system's sensitivity to $\alpha$.

    \centering
    \begin{minipage}{0.48\textwidth}
        \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{time_vs_alpha.png}

        \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{cost_vs_alpha.png}
        \caption{\textbf{Cost vs. $\alpha$}}
    \end{minipage}
   
\end{figure}

\textbf{1. The "V-Shaped" Time Curve:} 
The duration minimizes at $\alpha \approx 0.74$, forming a "Sweet Spot" where the parallel processing of rockets and elevators is perfectly synchronized ($\sim 137$ years). Deviating from this point causes bottleneck delays.

\textbf{2. The "Linear" Cost Curve:} 
Economic cost decreases monotonically as $\alpha \to 1$, driven by the elevator's lower marginal cost.

\textbf{Strategic Conclusion:}
Under the weighted objective ($Z$), the global optimum is identified at \textbf{$\alpha^* \approx 0.7432$ (Hybrid Strategy)}.
This strategy leverages the elevator for bulk transport (74\%) while using rockets for rapid delivery (26\%), achieving the best balance between the financial budget and mission timeline.

% Problem 2: Stochastic Optimization Strategy Under Uncertainty

%================================================================================
\section{Stochastic Optimization under Uncertainty}

\subsection{Problem analysis}
In the deterministic model of Problem 1, the Space Elevator demonstrated absolute dominance due to its extremely low marginal cost. However, for a trans-lunar project spanning a century (2050--2150), \textbf{Uncertainty} is the core challenge. In Problem 2, we construct a \textbf{Mean-Variance Stochastic Programming Model} to investigate: 

\textbf{Can we achieve overall optimality by combining two risky systems?}

\subsection{Stochastic Model Construction}

To capture the distinct risk profiles, we formulate the system dynamics as three coupled stochastic processes:

\subsubsection{ Space Elevator Malfunction}

We model the elevator as a continuous flow system subject to random interruptions. The total transport duration $T_E$ is a random variable defined by:
\begin{equation}    
T_E = \frac{M_{total}}{Cap_E} + \sum_{k=1}^{N_E} \tau_{repair}
\end{equation}
where the stochastic components are governed by:
\begin{itemize}    
\item \textbf{Event Frequency ($N_E$):} The number of failures follows a Poisson distribution conditional on a random failure rate $\Lambda$:    
\begin{equation}        
N_E \mid \Lambda \sim \text{Poisson}(\Lambda \cdot T_{ideal}), \quad \text{where } \Lambda \sim \text{Beta}(3, 997),T_{ideal}=\frac{M_{total}}{{Cap}_R}
\end{equation}    
The Beta prior captures the epistemic uncertainty (``fat-tail'' risk) of CNT material technology.    
\item \textbf{Repair Penalty ($\tau_{repair}$):} A fixed downtime (1 year) per failure event, representing the reconstruction period. (Abbreviated as $\tau$ in the following text)
\end{itemize}
And then we can obtain the expected value and variance of time.
\begin{align*}
\mathbb{E}[T_E] &= T_{\text{ideal}} + \tau \, \mathbb{E}[N_E] = T_{\text{ideal}} \left(1 + \tau \cdot \frac{a}{a+b}\right)\\
\operatorname{Var}(T_E) &= \tau^2 \operatorname{Var}(N_E) \\
\operatorname{Var}(N_E) &= \mathbb{E}[\operatorname{Var}(N_E \mid \Lambda)] + \operatorname{Var}(\mathbb{E}[N_E \mid \Lambda]) \\
&= T_{\text{ideal}} \cdot \frac{a}{a+b} + T_{\text{ideal}}^2 \cdot \frac{ab}{(a+b)^2(a+b+1)} \\
\Rightarrow \operatorname{Var}(T_E) &= \tau^2 \left[ T_{\text{ideal}} \cdot \frac{a}{a+b} + T_{\text{ideal}}^2 \cdot \frac{ab}{(a+b)^2(a+b+1)} \right]
\end{align*}


With concerns about the cost of the repair, the final cost of the elevator will be
\begin{align*}
    \mathbb{E}[C_{E}]=M\cdot(C_E^{elev}+C_E^{rkt})+\frac{MF_E}{Cap_E}+val_{rep}\cdot T_{ideal}\cdot\frac{a}{(a+b)}
    \\\operatorname{Var}(C_{E})=val_{rep}^2\cdot T_{\text{ideal}} \cdot \frac{a}{a+b} + val_{rep}^2\cdot T_{\text{ideal}}^2 \cdot \frac{ab}{(a+b)^2(a+b+1)},\\
    \text{where $a=3,b=997,T_{ideal}=\frac{M_{total}}{{Cap}_R}$}
\end{align*}


\subsubsection{Rockets failure}
We assume that the total number of rocket launches is
$cnt$ , and the probability of successful rocket launch is $q$, then
\begin{equation}    
cnt \sim \text{NegativeBinomial}\left ( cnt_s , q \right ) 
\end{equation}
We could get the cost of rockets lost
\[    
cost_f=val_R\cdot cnt_f=val_R\cdot(cnt-cnt_s)
\]
This also influences the efficiency of the rocket delivery.
The successful launches per year meet
\begin{equation}    
K'\sim \text{Binomial}(K,q)
\end{equation}
The time (where $\bar{P}$=125 \textbf{tons} is the rocket payload)
\[    
T_{R}=\frac{M_{total}}{K'\bar{P}}
\]
Treating T as an equation in K', we compute its variance and expectation using a Taylor expansion at the expected value. Using the first three terms to calculate the expectation and the first two terms to calculate the variance, we obtain the time for the rocket scenario.
\begin{align*}        
&T_{R}\approx(\frac{M_{total}}{\bar{P}})\cdot(\frac{1}{Kq}-\frac{K'-Kq}{K^2q^2}+\frac{(K'-Kq)^2}{K^3q^3})\\        
\Rightarrow&\mathbb{E}[T_{R}]=\frac{M_{total}}{\bar{P}}\cdot(\frac{1}{Kq}+\frac{1-q}{K^2q^2})\approx\frac{M_{total}}{Kq\bar{P}}\\        
&\operatorname{Var}(T_{R})=\frac{(1-q)M_{total}^2}{K^3q^3\bar{P}^2}
\end{align*}
Considering changes in marginal costs and fixed costs, along with the cost of lost rockets, we obtain the expected value and variance of the actual cost.
\begin{align*}    
\mathbb{E}[C_{R}]&=\frac{M_{total}C_R^{unit}}{q}+\frac{val_RM_{total}(1-q)}{\bar{P}q}+\frac{M_{total}}{Kq\bar{P}}    
\\    \operatorname{Var}(C_{R})&=\frac{{C_R^{unit}}^2M_{total}(1-q)}{q^2}+\frac{val^2_RM_{total}(1-q)}{\bar{P}q^2}+\frac{(1-q)M_{total}^2}{N^3q^3\bar{P}^2}
\end{align*}


\subsubsection{Tether Swaying}
Due to Coriolis forces, the tether will oscillate at high altitudes. If the oscillation amplitude exceeds the critical angle, the elevator will become temporarily inoperable. Since tether oscillation is a continuously recurring phenomenon, it can be treated as having a sufficiently large sample size over extended periods. Therefore, the average oscillation time and the probability that the oscillation amplitude remains below the critical angle can directly serve as measures of its availability.
The degree of oscillation follows a Rayleigh distribution.
\begin{align*}
    f(\theta ) & = \frac{\theta }{\sigma ^2}\exp (-\frac{\theta ^2}{2\sigma ^2})
\\A&=\int_{0}^{\theta _{cirt}}f(\theta )\mathrm{d}\theta =  1-\exp (-\frac{\theta_{cirt} ^2}{2\sigma ^2}) , \quad \text{where }\sigma=1.5^{\circ} ,\theta_{cirt}=4^{\circ} 
\\{Cap}_E&\gets {Cap}_E\cdot A
\end{align*}


\subsubsection{Objective Function Formulation}
We formulate the decision problem as a Mean-Variance Optimization. The objective function $S(\alpha)$ minimizes a weighted sum of normalized Expectation ($\tilde{E}$) and Standard Deviation ($\tilde{\sigma}$):

\begin{equation}
    \min_{\alpha \in [0,1]} S(\alpha) = \mathbf{W}^T \cdot \mathbf{V}(\alpha)
\end{equation}

where the performance vector $\mathbf{V}$ and weight vector $\mathbf{W}$ are defined as:
\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{V}(\alpha) = \begin{bmatrix} \tilde{E}[C] \\ \tilde{E}[T] \\ \tilde{\sigma}[C] \\ \tilde{\sigma}[T] \end{bmatrix}, \quad 
    \mathbf{W} = \begin{bmatrix} 0.35 \\ 0.25 \\ 0.25 \\ 0.15 \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

The weight vector $\mathbf{W}$ satisfies two strategic constraints derived from Section 4.1:
\begin{align}
    \text{Cost Priority:} & \quad w_C + w_{\sigma C} = 0.6 > w_T + w_{\sigma T} \\
    \text{Risk Aversion:} & \quad w_{\sigma C} + w_{\sigma T} = 0.4 \quad (\text{Stability Weight})
\end{align}
This formulation explicitly penalizes solution volatility, prioritizing operational controllability over marginal efficiency gains.

\subsection{Optimization Results}
Through a global scan of the allocation parameter $\alpha \in [0, 1]$ via 1,000,000 Monte Carlo simulations, we identified a robust optimal strategy that defies the deterministic intuition.

\subsubsection{Global Optimum}
The large-scale stochastic simulation reveals that the minimum of the comprehensive score $S(\alpha)$ occurs at \textbf{$\alpha = 0.7432$}, establishing the \textbf{hybrid Strategy} as the global robust optimum.

    \label{fig:S_alpha}
\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Resource Allocation:} The Space Elevator manages \textbf{74.32\%} of the payload as the strategic base load, while the Rocket Fleet addresses the remaining \textbf{25.68\%} to handle urgent throughput.
    \item \textbf{Systemic Performance Gains:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Efficiency:} Project duration is compressed to \textbf{146.9 years}, a \textbf{25.6\% reduction} compared to the deterministic pure-elevator baseline.
        \item \textbf{Stability Improvement:} Remarkably, the hybrid cost standard deviation ($\sigma_C \approx 121$B) is lower than that of the pure elevator ($\sigma_C \approx 123$B). This confirms that integrating "individually risky" rockets into a dual-mode fleet paradoxically enhances the \textbf{stability of the entire logistics portfolio}.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Mechanism Analysis}

The superiority of the optimal strategy ($\alpha^* = 0.7432$) stems from two physical mechanisms:

\textbf{1. Asymmetric Equilibrium:}
While the theoretical time-sync point lies at $\alpha \approx 0.71$, the global optimum shifts rightward to $\alpha^* = 0.74$. This deviation represents a strategic trade-off: the system accepts a negligible temporal penalty to exploit the Space Elevator's marginal cost advantage, maximizing the comprehensive score $Z$.

\textbf{2. The Stability Dividend:}
By diversifying transport modes, the hybrid strategy suppresses volatility through quadratic risk superposition:
\begin{equation}
    \sigma_{total} = \sqrt{\alpha^2 \sigma_E^2 + (1-\alpha)^2 \sigma_R^2}
\end{equation}
Since the squared coefficients ($\alpha^2$) dampen individual variances, the hybrid model achieves a global stability ($\sigma_C \approx 121.6$B) superior to even the pure Space Elevator ($\sigma_C \approx 123.6$B). This effect hedges the elevator's delay risks against the rocket's operational risks.

\subsection{Sensitive analysis}
\subsubsection{Stochastic Robustnes}

A Monte Carlo simulation ($N=10^6$) on the comprehensive objective $S$ reveals a distinct stability hierarchy (Figure \ref{fig:score_dist}). The Hybrid Strategy (Green) exhibits a sharp, narrow peak at the global optimum ($S \approx 0.25$), contrasting sharply with the high volatility of the Pure Rocket strategy. Driven by the \textbf{Quadratic Smoothing} of independent failure modes ($\text{Var}_{Hybrid} \approx \alpha^2 \sigma_E^2 + (1-\alpha)^2 \sigma_R^2$), this architecture achieves a \textbf{15.2\% compression in extreme risk ($95^{th}$ percentile)}, confirming its robustness against systemic shocks (Table \ref{tab:risk_metrics}).

    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{figures/risk_distribution_comparison.png}

Pure Elevator & $0.45$ & Medium ($0.08$) & Moderate & - \\
\textbf{Hybrid ($\alpha^*$)} & \textbf{0.25} & \textbf{Low (0.04)} & \textbf{Robust} & \textbf{15.2\% Compression} \\ \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}



\subsubsection{Rocket Payload Sensitivity}

To evaluate the long-term viability of our model, we analyzed the sensitivity of the optimal strategy to the rocket payload $\bar{P}$.

The simulation reveals that $\alpha^*$ is notably responsive to rocket efficiency. As $\bar{P}$ increases from 125t to 150t, the optimal elevator share $\alpha^*$ decreases by approximately \textbf{8\%}, shifting the strategic focus toward the rocket fleet's superior throughput. 

A critical threshold is identified at \textbf{$\bar{P}_{crit} \approx 145$ tons}. Beyond this inflection point, the hybrid advantage expands non-linearly, as the increased payload capacity provides sufficient margin to offset the rocket’s stochastic costs.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{figures/alpha vs p.png}
    \caption{\textbf{Strategic Migration of Optimal $\alpha^*$.} The contour plot illustrates the evolution of the optimal $\alpha^*$ (green dashed line) as average rocket payload ($\bar{P}$) increases. The dark blue region shifts towards lower $\alpha$ values, indicating a strategic pivot towards more rocket-intensive logistics as technology advances.}
    \label{fig:p_alpha_landscape}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Physical Aging Effect}
In the baseline model, the failure rate is constant. However, in reality, elevator tethers age over time. We introduce a \textbf{Weibull Distribution ($k>1$)} to model this \textbf{Wear-out Phase}.
\begin{equation}
    p(t)=\frac{k}{\lambda}\cdot(\frac{t}{\lambda})^{k-1}, \quad \text{where $k$ is the shape parameter, $\lambda$ is the scale parameter.}
\end{equation}
The Pure Elevator strategy duration is as long as 197 years, meaning that in the later stage ($t > 150$ years), the system will enter a \textbf{High Failure Rate Zone}, and maintenance costs will spiral out of control. The hybrid strategy compresses the duration to 146 years, successfully completing the mission \textbf{before} the elevator enters the severe aging phase.

\textbf{Conclusion:} This corroborates the rationality of $\alpha=0.74$ — \textbf{shortening the duration is not just for speed, but also avoiding the risk of physical aging in the later stages.}






\section{Planetary Water Resource Supply Assessment}


\subsection{Baseline Demind Estimation}

To quantify the logistics demand, we first established the baseline water consumption profile based on the \textit{Lunar Base Water Cycle Prediction Report}. We define the simulation scenario as a \textbf{Phase III Colony} with a population of $N_{pop} = 100,000$, operating under a "Non-Agricultural Mode" (food imported).

Based on physiological data and industrial requirements, the Annual Gross Water Demand ($R_t$) is estimated at \textbf{$3.0 \times 10^6$ tons/year}. The detailed allocation is summarized in Table \ref{tab:water_demand_breakdown}.

\subsubsection{Baseline Demand Estimation ($R_t$)}

To quantify the logistics demand, we established the baseline water consumption profile based on the \textit{Lunar Base Water Cycle Prediction Report}. For a \textbf{Phase III Colony ($N_{pop}=100,000$)} operating under a Non-Agricultural Mode, the total Annual Gross Water Demand ($R_t$) is fixed at \textbf{$3.0 \times 10^6$ tons}.

The detailed breakdown of this demand is presented in Table \ref{tab:water_demand_breakdown}.

\end{table}

This aggregate throughput ($R_t$) serves as the constant input flow for our subsequent System Dynamics modeling.

\subsection{System Dynamics Modeling of Water Cycle}
To quantify the logistics demand under population growth, we established a System Dynamics (SD) model governed by mass conservation and safety constraints.

\subsubsection{Governing Equations}
The water storage state $S_t$ evolves according to the net difference between replenishment and irreversible loss:
\begin{equation}
    S_t = S_{t-1} - \underbrace{(1 - r) R_t}_{\text{Net Loss}} + \underbrace{Sup_t}_{\text{External Supply}}
\end{equation}
where $r=0.98$ represents the current state-of-the-art recycling efficiency, \textbf{based on the ISS Environmental Control and Life Support System (ECLSS)}. 

To ensure resilience against stochastic supply failures, we impose a \textbf{Water Security Constraint}:
\begin{equation}
    S_t = \gamma \cdot R_t, \quad (\gamma = 1.8)
\end{equation}
Based on our research, we introduced the \textbf{coefficient $\gamma$} to ensure the water storage $S_{t}$ provides a strategic reserve equivalent to \textbf{21.6 months of demand}. This model aims to \textbf{cover a potential skipped launch window or catastrophic supply chain interruption}.

\subsubsection{Coupling Solution}
Substituting the safety constraint ($\gamma$) into the balance equation yields the analytical function for required external supply:
\begin{equation}
    Sup_t = \underbrace{1.8(R_t - R_{t-1})}_{\text{Growth Burden}} + \underbrace{0.02 R_t}_{\text{Maintenance Burden}}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Simulation Parameters and Output}

Building on the optimization results from Section 4, we apply the identified optimal architecture—the \textbf{Hybrid Strategy ($\alpha^* \approx 0.74$)}—to the water replenishment mission. This approach leverages the cost-efficiency of the Space Elevator for bulk transport ($74\%$ of the payload) while utilizing the Rocket fleet for rapid, flexible delivery ($26\%$).

We input the derived annual replenishment demand ($dM = 60,000 \text{ tons}$) into the validated Hybrid Logistics Model. The simulation yields the following performance metrics for the steady-state water supply chain:

\textbf{Mission Duration} & \textbf{1.06 Months} & High Operational Resilience \\
Annual Throughput & $60,000$ Tons & Meets Safety Buffer Requirement \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}








\section{Planetary Sustainability Assessment }

\subsection{Sustainability Evaluation Framework}
While previous sections optimized logistics strictly for Economic Cost ($C$) and Time Efficiency ($T$), the transport of $10^8$ tons of mass implies an unprecedented scale of industrial activity. To address \textbf{Problem 4}, we integrate a \textbf{Sustainability Constraint Module} into the decision framework to evaluate ecological externalities.

We established a hierarchical indicator system (Table \ref{tab:env_indicators}), assigning internal weights based on the spatial scale and irreversibility of the impact.

\begin{table}[H]
\centering

\textbf{Noise ($I_{NP}$)} & 0.20 & Regional & Community Annoyance (\%HA) \\
\textbf{Land ($I_{LU}$)} & 0.10 & Local & Safety Exclusion Zones \\ \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Quantitative Modeling of Externalities}

\subsubsection{Noise Pollution: FAA/FICON Standard Model}
To rigorously quantify the acoustic impact, we implemented the regulatory models from the \textbf{U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)} and the \textbf{Federal Interagency Committee on Noise (FICON)}.

\paragraph{Day-Night Average Sound Level ($L_{dn}$)}
We calculate the cumulative noise exposure using the \textbf{FAA Order 1050.1F} methodology. Unlike a simple energy average, this model imposes a 10 dB penalty on night-time operations to reflect heightened sensitivity:
\begin{equation}
    L_{dn} = SEL + 10 \log_{10}(N_{eff}) - 49.4
\end{equation}
where $SEL=120$ dB is the Sound Exposure Level of a heavy-lift rocket. Using the simulation parameter of annual launches ($N=1472$), the effective daily frequency is $N_{eff} \approx 14.9$. This yields a severe noise baseline for the Rocket Fleet of \textbf{$L_{dn} \approx 82.3$ dB}. In contrast, the Space Elevator is modeled with a reference level of \textbf{$L_{dn} = 62.0$ dB}.

\paragraph{High Annoyance (\%HA) Prediction}
We employ the \textbf{FICON (1992) Logistic Curve} to estimate the percentage of the surrounding population that is "Highly Annoyed":
\begin{equation}
    \%HA = \frac{100}{1 + \exp(11.13 - 0.141 \cdot L_{dn})}
\end{equation}
The results indicate a catastrophic gap: the Rocket Fleet triggers a \textbf{61.6\% High Annoyance rate} (nearly two-thirds of the population), whereas the Space Elevator maintains a manageable \textbf{8.4\%}.


\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{figures/ficon_curve_corrected_82.3.png}
    \caption{\textbf{FICON Logistic Curve}}
    \label{fig:env_shift}
\end{figure}




\subsubsection{Land Use Intensity}
The land footprint is modeled as a function of total throughput. 
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Space Elevator:} Requires a fixed anchor zone of approximately \textbf{150 $\text{km}^2$}.
    \item \textbf{Rocket Fleet:} Requires dynamic exclusion zones that scale linearly with mission frequency. To support the throughput of $10^8$ tons, the total safety exclusion area expands to \textbf{$\sim 29,096 \text{km}^2$}, reflecting the massive buffer zones needed for launch failure containment and acoustic safety.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Atmospheric Pollution Analysis}
Completing the $10^8$ ton mission via rocketry requires approximately \textbf{1,000,000 launches} (benchmark: Starship, 100t payload). We condense the emission inventory analysis into Table \ref{tab:pollution_inventory}.

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\caption{\textbf{Atmospheric Impact Inventory: Rocket Fleet vs. Space Elevator.}}
\label{tab:pollution_inventory}
\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.2}
\begin{tabular}{l l l}
\toprule
\textbf{Pollutant} & \textbf{Rocket Fleet (Plan B)} & \textbf{Space Elevator (Plan A)} \\ 
\midrule
\textbf{1. $CO_2$ Emissions} & \textbf{76 Billion Tons} & \textbf{$\approx$ Negligible} \\ 
\textbf{2. Black Carbon} & \textbf{4 Million Tons} & \textbf{Zero} \\ 
\textbf{3. Ozone Threat} & \textbf{High} (Triggers PSCs) & \textbf{None} \\ 
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

As shown in Table \ref{tab:pollution_inventory}, the Rocket Strategy constitutes a \textbf{Climate Catastrophe}. The accumulation of 76 billion tons of greenhouse gases and stratospheric aerosols creates an insurmountable "Green Barrier," rendering Plan B ecologically prohibitive.









\subsection{Comprehensive Scoring and Objective Function}

We formulate the Global Objective Function $S_{total}(\alpha)$ by integrating the normalized environmental score $E(\alpha)$ with the logistics performance $Z_{logistics}(\alpha)$. Recognizing that environmental policy priorities may vary, we introduce an adjustable weight parameter $w_{env}$ (where $w_{env} \in [0, 1]$):
\begin{equation}
    S_{total}(\alpha) = (1 - w_{env}) \cdot Z_{logistics}(\alpha) + w_{env} \cdot E(\alpha)
\end{equation}
The sensitivity of the optimal strategy $\alpha^*$ to changes in $w_{env}$ will be rigorously analyzed in the subsequent section.

\paragraph{Simulation Results}
The computational results (Table \ref{tab:env_results_summary}) reveal a stark disparity between the transportation modes. Most notably, the Rocket Fleet's noise levels ($L_{dn} \approx 82.3$ dB) trigger a severe high annoyance rate of \textbf{61.6\%}, meaning nearly two-thirds of the surrounding population would be significantly disturbed.

\begin{table}[H]

\caption{\textbf{Computed Environmental Metrics Summary.}}
\label{tab:env_results_summary}
\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.3}
\begin{tabular}{lccc}
\toprule
\textbf{Metric} & \textbf{Pure Rocket ($\alpha=0$)} & \textbf{Pure Elevator ($\alpha=1$)} & \textbf{Gap / Ratio} \\ \midrule
\textbf{Noise Level ($L_{dn}$)} & 82.3 dB & \textbf{62.0 dB} & +20.3 dB \\
\textbf{High Annoyance (\%HA)} & 61.6\% & \textbf{8.4\%} & \textbf{7.3x} \\
\textbf{Land Footprint} & $\sim 29,096 \text{ km}^2$ & \textbf{150 $\text{km}^2$} & 193x \\
\textbf{Atmospheric ($CO_2$)} & 76 Billion Tons & \textbf{$\sim$ Negligible} & Critical \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}







\subsection{Sensitivity Analysis: The Impact of Green Policy}

We tested how the optimal strategy changes when we increase the importance of environmental protection (weight $w_{env}$) from 0\% to 50\%. The results are shown in Figure \ref{fig:sensitivity}.

Through our sensitivity analysis, we found that our final decision changes as the environmental weight $w_{env}$ shifts:


\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Before 10\% (Money \& Time Focus):} 
    When we care mostly about cost and speed ($w_{env} < 10\%$), the \textbf{Hybrid Strategy ($\alpha \approx 0.74$)} is superior.

    \item \textbf{After 10\% (Sustainability Focus):} 
    Once the environmental weight reaches \textit{10\%}, the huge pollution from rockets (76 billion tons of $CO_2$ and noise) makes them too "expensive" in our scoring system. The model immediately switches to the \textbf{Pure Space Elevator ($\alpha = 1.0$)}.
\end{itemize}
