# PROMPT FOR SPACE ELEVATOR SYSTEM DIAGRAM (2026 MCM Problem B)

Create a **black-and-white academic engineering schematic** of a space elevator transportation system for Earth-to-Moon logistics. The diagram must be **physically accurate, geometrically rigorous, and publication-ready** for academic journals.

---

## EARTH RENDERING (CRITICAL)

- Render Earth as a **true 3D sphere** with correct spatial perspective and depth.
- Apply **semi-transparent shading** to the Earth sphere, allowing partial visibility of the far side.
- Depth occlusion, spherical curvature, and perspective foreshortening must follow **physical optics principles**.
- Display a **complete world map** on Earth's surface with continents and oceans clearly visible.
- Overlay a **light-colored latitude-longitude grid**.
- Draw the **equatorial plane explicitly** as a great circle encircling the Earth.
- The line connecting the space elevator and the center of the earth lies in the equatorial plane (the plane of the synchronous orbit), and the Angle between them is 120 degrees. ONLY THREE ELEVATORS, NOT FOUR!!!

---

## THREE GALACTIC HARBORS (SPACE ELEVATORS) - GEOMETRY IS MANDATORY

Each Galactic Harbor consists of THREE components:
1. **Earth Port** — located **ON the Earth's equatorial surface** (NOT at GEO, NOT floating in space).
2. **Two parallel tether cables** — extending **outward from the Earth Port through space** to beyond GEO.
3. **Apex Anchor** — positioned **beyond GEO**, serving as counterweight and rocket launch platform.

### CRITICAL PLACEMENT RULE

- All three Galactic Harbors are positioned **exactly on the equatorial great circle**.
- They are spaced at **exactly 120-degree angular intervals** around the equator.
- **DO NOT use 90-degree spacing.** The 120-degree geometry is mandatory.

### PERSPECTIVE VISIBILITY (MANDATORY)

Due to correct 120° spacing and Earth's spherical occlusion:
- **Only ONE Galactic Harbor** is fully visible on the near side of Earth.
- The **other TWO Galactic Harbors** are mostly on the far side of Earth.
- For the far-side harbors, only the **upper portions (Apex Anchors and upper cables)** are visible, appearing near Earth's limb.
- All structures hidden behind Earth must be drawn as **light dashed lines**.

---

## TETHER CABLES (DETAILED SPECIFICATIONS)

- Each Galactic Harbor has **TWO parallel cables**.
- Cables must be drawn **noticeably thicker** than other lines in the diagram.
- Cables are **confined to the equatorial plane**.
- Cables **originate from the Earth Port ON Earth's surface** and extend outward into space.
- **CRITICAL: The Earth Port is ON the planet surface at the equator, NOT at orbital altitude.**

---

## ELevators

- Show three **elevator** traveling along the cables on each Galactic Harbour.
- Elevators are **rectangular box-shaped pods** attached to and aligned along the cable direction.
- Each elevator is **crossed by two cables** instead of one tether cable for one elevator.
- So each galactic Harbour has one elevator, but two tether cables.

---

## APEX ANCHORS (COUNTERWEIGHT STATIONS)

- Located **beyond GEO altitude**, at the terminal end of each cable pair.
- Drawn **significantly larger than cable diameter** — large enough to serve as a rocket launch facility.
- Each Apex Anchor includes:
  - A **compact space station structure**
  - **Docking interfaces**
  - **At least one rocket** launching toward the Moon

### ROCKET ORIENTATION (CRITICAL CORRECTION)

- Rockets launching from Apex Anchors must be **aligned along the radial direction** — i.e., along the same line as the cable and Earth's center.
- **DO NOT draw rockets pointing "upward" perpendicular to the cable.**
- The rocket, cable, and Earth's center must be **collinear**.

---

## GEOSYNCHRONOUS ORBIT (GEO)

- Mark GEO altitude clearly with a **labeled dashed circular orbit line** around Earth.
- The cables extend **through and beyond** this GEO line to reach the Apex Anchors.

---

## EARTH-BASED LAUNCH SITES (10 LOCATIONS)

Mark **10 rocket launch sites** on Earth's surface as **small green dots**.

Position each according to approximate real-world latitude/longitude:
1. Alaska, USA
2. California, USA
3. Texas, USA
4. Florida, USA
5. Virginia, USA
6. Baikonur, Kazakhstan
7. Kourou, French Guiana
8. Satish Dhawan Space Centre, India
9. Taiyuan Satellite Launch Center, China
10. Mahia Peninsula, New Zealand

### VISIBILITY RULES

- Launch sites on the **visible hemisphere**: solid green dots.
- Launch sites on the **far side**: semi-transparent light green dots, visible through the translucent Earth but geographically accurate.

---

## MOON

- Include the **Moon** in the same frame with correct spatial perspective and proper proportional scale relative to Earth.
- Clearly label a **lunar colony** on the Moon's surface representing the 100,000-person habitat described in the problem.
- All transport trajectories terminate at the lunar colony.

---

## TRANSPORT ROUTES (THREE PATHWAYS)

1. **Earth Port → Apex Anchor**: Cargo ascends via elevators along the space elevator cables.
2. **Apex Anchor → Moon**: Rockets launch from Apex Anchors toward the lunar colony.
3. **Earth Surface → Moon**: Traditional rockets launch directly from Earth-based sites (those ten green dot) to the Moon.

- All trajectories must follow **smooth curved paths** consistent with orbital mechanics.
- Use **red, blue, or yellow** for route highlighting.

---

## VISUAL STYLE (MANDATORY)

- **Black-and-white line art** suitable for academic publication.
- **White background**.
- Primary structures in **black or dark gray**.
- **Dashed lines only** for occluded/hidden structures.
- **Red, blue, yellow** permitted only for route/orbit emphasis.
- **Green** exclusively for Earth launch site markers.
- Vector-style precision with clean line weights and technical legibility.

---

## STRICTLY PROHIBITED

- Artistic, cinematic, or stylized rendering.
- Exaggerated symmetry or simplified layouts for visual appeal.
- Flattening Earth into 2D representation.
- Adjusting Galactic Harbor positions away from true 120° spacing.
- Decorative elements, human figures, or non-functional objects.
- Placing Earth Ports at GEO or in orbit — they must be ON Earth's surface.
- Drawing Apex Anchor rockets pointing perpendicular to the cable — they must point radially outward.
- Using 90° spacing between harbors instead of the required 120°. 
- Only Three Galactic Harbour, three Earth Port, Three elevators, six tether cables(each elevator tow cables).
